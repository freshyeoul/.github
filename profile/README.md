# 👋 Welcome to Pado!

Pado is a group of four normal guys creating waves of positive change. In society, we call the new reverberation "waves." Team Pado wants to have the influence to create ripples of change in society.

## 🌊 About Team Pado

Pado is a form of wave, and a wave has the following four characteristics.

1. **Reflection** - We move forward even if we face rejection in the market.
2. **Refraction** - Like a wave propagating in the shortest time, we always maintain a lean attitude.
3. **Diffraction** - We continuously move forward based on flexible thinking.
4. **Interference** - We're a team that generates maximum synergy when all members come together.

## 📌 Our Core Values

1. Extreme Honesty - We share honest thoughts that everyone has.
2. NOT nice IS NOT rude - But we communicate politely during the process.
